# T-LGL network

1. run "TLGL_net.jl" to get the network model, which is stored in "net.jld2" after execution.
   (If you see this model file exists already, then no need to run it again.)
2. run "target_set_Z.j" to get a proper target set Z, which is stored in "Z.jld2".
   (If you see this model file exists already, then no need to run it again.)
3. run "TLGL.jl" for analysis.
